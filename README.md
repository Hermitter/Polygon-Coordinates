# Overview
This website allows you to upload an image/video file and draw a custom polygon over it. Once you finish drawing,
you can obtain the coordinates of each polygon vertex. These coordinates can be used in another program to draw the polygon that
you made. This essentially enables you to create and save a specific zone in an image/video file for any application that requires 
a segmented areas. The results given will be the number of vertices, followed by the (x,y) coordinate of each vertex.
